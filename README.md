## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I wanted to get a deeper understanding in developers' economic return around the world, using Stack Overflow data over the years to understand:

1. Which Countries are best for developers in terms of compensation?
2. Which Countries show an higher than average compensation for developers?
3. What are the main differences between the richest and the poorest Countries?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The repository contains the data files necessary to run the analysis.
The full analysis is contained in the jupyter notebook. Most of the functions are written in a separate file that needs to be imported named 'AidFunctions.py'.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().
